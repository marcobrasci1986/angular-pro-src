changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default = runs every time we change something

changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush = Only run the the object reference has changed (immutable objects).
OnPush is faster and more effecient. Stateless components or represantational component -> state changes is done with @Output event emitters

Angular is faster when using object reference comparisons. When you use immutable objects, Angular does not have to check the previous en the next values
to detect that an update is due. Resolves in a better rerendering of the components
